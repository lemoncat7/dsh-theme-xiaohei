# bloub

Revision: b4bb3c1b5f93c7b87a2e8d620f667c4093d97749

`src/vendor/bloub/` contains the framework-free animation engine from bloub.
Authored body profiles, state choreography, gaze projection and interruption
blending are retained. Local changes: NodeNext `.js` import extensions; lazy
custom-shape fitting table (unknown profiles bypass the catalogue); repeat the
blink calendar for long-running sessions; expose eye bounds, uncompressed tangent
and lid openness for a separate hollow-eye renderer; interpolate notification
badge/notch radii during entry, exit and interrupted morphs. The theme supplies a custom
Heixiu radial profile and face through the upstream customisation API. Its gesture
tracks, DOM lifecycle, placement and scheduler are separate from the upstream core.
No Vue application, editor, video exporter or media dependencies are included.

The original project recreates an x.ai avatar; its MIT license covers code, not
ownership of the character designs. This theme is an unofficial fan work and is
not endorsed by the owners of Luo Xiaohei or x.ai.
